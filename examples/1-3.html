My husband, Amal, used to spend a lot of time in helicopters, his bow tie peeking out of his flight suit. This was in Baltimore, where he and I were pediatricians. Amal worked in a hospital’s intensive care unit, and part of his job was flying with very sick children who needed to be transferred by air. When I expressed worry about him doing this, he would point out that more people die in cars than helicopters.

And then, four years and two children into our marriage, I watched from a trailing car as the rear left tire exploded on the S.U.V. he was driving, causing the vehicle to flip over twice, crushing him.

The ensuing grief, for me, felt like being near one of Amal’s landing helicopters — a swirl of noise and confusion, the earth vibrating. In the years since his death, my grief subsided — enough for me to consider dating, of all people, a helicopter engineer.

Brian emailed me through Match.com about 13 years after Amal died. His profile name was “RelaxExhale,” and he wrote that he believed in the scientific method. A science-minded guy who was into yoga seemed a great match for me.

Over the phone, though, I learned that “RelaxExhale” was not about yoga; it was Brian coaching himself to take the leap into online dating. By then I was living in New Haven, Conn., and our first date was on a warm Sunday morning at a coffee shop called Cafe Romeo.

“I feel like you’re not like my kids’ pediatrician,” Brian said. “You do other stuff.”
